# Week 4 Group Code Review

**Note:** There are no planned exercises this day because the students didn't have new materials in the LMS.

## Primary objectives

- Understand the significance of conducting a code review
- Receive code review feedback on the individual project

## Objective 1: Understand the significance of conducting a code review

### Opening

Open the discussion by talking with the students about code reviews. Ask them how they might imagine having someone review their work can be beneficial. Some examples might include:
* spot issues with the code
* suggest ways to make the code more readable
* find inconsistency between the code in review and the rest of the codebase
* looking for code that doesn't follow best practices
* share working knowledge with other team members
* learn something new from someone else's code

Students who are new to code reviews often find them intimidating. Some of the concerns or misconceptions that students have about code reviews include:
* code reviews are only about spotting mistakes
* you can "fail" a code review and lose your job
* only an expert can conduct a code review

### Next steps

It may help to compare a code review to having someone review an email before you send it or a paper before it's submitted. Share your own professional experience participating and conducting code reviews with your students.

## Objective 2: Practice giving and receiving feedback on the individual project

### Opening
Use the remaining class time to help students experience receiving and giving code review feedback on their projects. There's not likely to be any variation from project to project with this project. It'll be more important to emphasize the mechanics of a code review and lower the intimidation barrier.

### Code review 
Conduct a series of short code reviews so that students have an example to follow:

1. Ask someone in the class to share their screen and demonstrate a feature of their application. 
2. After demonstrating the feature, ask the student to switch to the IDE and show the code behind that feature. 
3. Pause, and give everyone three to four minutes to read the code. Ask the class to write down any comments that they may have. 
4. As the instructor, explain to the class what the code does. After explaining the code, provide one positive and one constructive piece of feedback.
5. Ask one other student in the class to share a comment that they observed.

Repeat these steps a few times. When the class becomes more comfortable, ask students to provide their explanations for what the code is doing. Encourage reviewers to note something that they might have learned.

**Note:** If you notice that your class or some students are having difficulty coming up with meaningful critiques, tell them to ask questions. Then they get to learn something new as a reviewer.

### Next steps

Have students split up into groups of three or four and take turns demonstrating a feature in their code while the rest of the group asks questions or provides feedback. Before you break into groups, tell the students they can use some of the following prompts if they're not sure what to look for:
* Does the code meet the requirements? Are there any scenarios where it doesn't work?
* What's one change you could make to make the code more readable?
* Does the code follow a style consistently, for example spacing, indentation, or naming conventions?
* Are there any parts of the code that require a comment explaining how it works?
* Are there any comments that don't reflect what the code is doing?
* What's one thing you learned reading this code?
